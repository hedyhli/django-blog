# Django Blog

A hello-world kinda blog built with Django and Bulma.


### Setup Notes:

* Install with `req_local.txt`
* Move `nitro.py` to the `styles` directory of where `pygments` is installed
* Add `.env` with `DEBUG` and `SECRET_KEY` in the same directory as `settings.py`
* Check out aliases in `scripts/setaliases` and scripts in `scripts/`
* Remember to `migrate` and run the project and make sure everything works properly
before making changes
* Remember to `createsuperuser` so you can access the Django Admin
